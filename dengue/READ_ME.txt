Predicting Dengue Spread

Project Overview:

In this project I examine features impacting the occurrence of Dengue Fever and employ several machine learning models to predict its spread. Dengue surveillance data is provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, as well as the Department of Defense's Naval Medical Research Unit 6 and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, in collaboration with the Peruvian government and U.S. universities. Environmental and climate data is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The project is part of the "Predict the Next Pandemic Initiative"

The data set is hosted at Driven Data, which provides datasets that explore social and humanitarian issues. They also host machine learning competitions, similar to Kaggle, but the overarching goal of all competitions is to provides some sort of humanitarian benefit. It's machine learning with a heart!

If you are unfamiliar with Dengue Fever (it is uncommon in the US), is a mosquito-borne tropical disease common in more than 110 countries, mainly in Asia and South America. Each year between 50 and 528 million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die.
