The aim of this project is to perform binary classification on cells identified in 
Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy image of the human retina. This 
classification is typically performed manually, which is a slow and tedious task. 
It is also hightly subjected. It is common for trained reviewers to differ by ~10%. 
Hence an automated approach is hightly desireable. This notebook presents a machine 
learning approah this problem. This task was initiated in the summer of 2017 using 
Matlab. The current notebook represents recent updates to that work, using Python 
and Scikitlearn.
